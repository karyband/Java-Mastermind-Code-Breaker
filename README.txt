Project 1 Mastermind Code Breaker
2/20/15

=== Overview ===
This project, the task was to construct a Mastermind game
but with the tables turned. The user acts as the code maker
and the program needs to be equipped with the capability
of analyzing the users black and white peg responses and be able
to crack the code. In my lab I have only three files: interface for
the codebreaker, the codebreaker class, and the play class. In the 
codebreaker class are all the methods the computer will use to crack
the code, and the play class starts the game and enables the user 
input. An example interaction with my program can be seen in
